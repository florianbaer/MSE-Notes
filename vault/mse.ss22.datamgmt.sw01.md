# Postgres 
Is a post-relational extensinble DBMS - similar to oracle, ms sql server, ingers. Close to SQL standard but "conservative" 
with special types for e.g. spatial data etc...
And even further extensible with extensions (e.g. PostGIS)
- **Good total costs of ownership**
- Not so good mobile mobile sync
- Not so good html form generator
