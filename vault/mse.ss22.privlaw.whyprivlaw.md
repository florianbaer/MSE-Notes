# Why privacy and law
For companies it is a huge **reputation risk** if they misuse personal data!

Big change incoming with the new privacy law (GDPR - General Data Protection Regulation)

# Data Protection
- is defined as the protection of personal integrity agains infringements (Civil Law - ZGB Art. 28)
- **established** the second half of the 20th century
- means
  - informational **self-determination**
  - protection of the **personality** in the data-processing
  - protection of **privacy**
  - protection form **abusive data processing**


- [ ] insert theory of spheres


Any infringement (Verletzung) of the integrity/personality is illegal unless it is justified by the consent of the person whose rights are infringed or by law or by an overriding private or public interest
Then you could go to the court

- Swiss Federal Act on Data Protection (DSG) will come into force in 2022.
- Canton and communal: Every canton has its own flavor.

New Data Protection law only applies to natural persons by 
- natural persons (**natural and juristic personen!!!**)
- federal bodies

It does not apply to
- personal data that is processed by a naturla person _exclusivly for personal use_ and which is not _disclosed to outsiders_
- deliberations of the federal assembly and in parliamentary committees

Recording is different - see privacy notice in teams

# Territorial scope
Swiss law is now applicable in foreign coutnries! **Marktortprinzip**
> **This act is applicable to fact patterns that have an effect in switzerland, _even if they occured abroad_ !!!**

# **revDSG**
## **Article 5** - definitions
- personal data
- data subject
- sensitive personal data
- processing
- **Controller** private person (human or company) that decides on the purpose and the means of the processing - **so not the processor is the controller but their boss/company which gave the order to process the data**
- **processor**

Data must be destroyed when it is no longer needed regarded to the purpose (e.g. apply for a new job)

Anyone who processes personal data must ascertain that the data is accurate. 

Example:
Miss Florian BÃ¤r $\to$ i have the right that this data is corrected!!

You have to inform the people how you use their data!

## Proportionate

Do the reason of the collected personal data justify the penetraion in ones privacy?

Important regarding websites - Cookie Buttons must look the same - you can not guide the use one of the buttons.

## data security
the controller and the processor must ensure (sich versichern) with adequate technical and organisational measures, security concerns are addressed!

## inventory of processing activities
controller and processor keep an inventroy of their processing activities

## notification
The controller shall notify the FDPIC (Datenschutzbeauftragter) as soon as possible after a security breach

# access rights (Art. 25 revDSG)
- send the data back and destroy all the data
  
Anybody has the right when personal data of him is collected and for what purpose it is used
- for how long
- how as access
- purpose

actual data protection law goes further than the new DSG



## limitations
the controller has the right refuse, restrict or defer provision of information
- is manifestly nfounded in particular if it pursues a purpose that is contrary to data protection or is obviously of a frivolous nature!

The data subject shall receive the information required in order to enable him to assert his rights under this Act and to ensure the transparent processing of data.
- **in 30 day**
- **free of charge**


Any person may request from the controller, free of charge, the disclosure of the personal data that he has isclosed to him in a standard electronic format if:
- the controller processes the data in an automated manner; and

# Sactions / Penalties
Fines up to 250'000 Swiss Francs are quite small compared to other european countries!

328b OR (code of obligation)
- The employer may data about the employee only process as it concerns his qualification for the employment or are inevitable for the execution of the employment. The regulations of the Swiss Data Protection Act are applicable.

# Simple case
> Nova-AG, headquartered in Dornbirn (AT), has developed a software that enables large companies to automatically analyse the absences of their employees. HR managers automatically receive profiles of their employees and their absences through the system and can thus intervene in a supportive manner. Nova AG has a subsidiary in Switzerland, which sells the software and the service hosted in Austria.
