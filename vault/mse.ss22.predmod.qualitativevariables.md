# Qualitative Variables
First we need to create a dummy variable

1 if the person is female and 0 if the person is male

See page 28 in slides

**There is always one fewer dummy variables then the number of levels** as there is a baseline dummy variable
There are many ways of doing it - no difference on fit but has effects on the interpretation of coeï¬ƒcients and p-values
