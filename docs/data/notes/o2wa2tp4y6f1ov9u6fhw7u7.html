<p>Law are not only books - there are agreements for rules as well.</p>
<p>Law is social framework
Rules save energy - compared to Parents and children
Without <strong>Risk</strong> - most businesses are not successful.
Lawyer should not only support one side - more find the best solution for both sides of a given problem.
In technical projects legal support is necessary as early as possible! Otherwise they might be <strong>shot off</strong> in the very last minute!
By law the management is personally responsible to organise &#x26; control the legal compliance! (Art. 754 OR)</p>

<p>Privacy and the right to forget is essential to develop personally (without social control)
It protects people
We spread data everywhere with the risk for loosing reputation.
Personal data has a financial worth.
Young generations are more sensitive to privacy than the boomers.</p>
