# Case 1

> As engineer you’re responsible for the evaluation of a new heating system for your industrial plant. Any legal requirements?

Yes indeed. First of all I must do my job with "due diligence" while doing the evalution. Then I must follow the standards that nobody gets hurt while operating these systems when they will be installed. Further I can not prefer a company where I have a friend of mine working at without objective reason.

# Case 2
You developed an injection moulding machine that produces „tailor-made“ plastic eye lenses. The process needs a sub-millimetre handling. To achieve that you use an optical camera. The producer of the camera developed for that specific machine an optical recognition software.
> Which main legal problems can you recognise? Discussion.

What happens if the camera breaks or is wrongly calibrated and a user of these plastic lenses gets hurt? 
Further you have to ensure you get all the medical certifications needed for the country you want to sell these lenses. What if you don't do the certifications?

# Case 3
Google Maps shows the actual traffic situation. You plan to use this information to categorise areas that are noisier and therefore real estates have a low worth. You integrate this information into your platform and sell it online.
> Any legal questions?

The data obtained by google is proably owned by google, so you can not sell data collected by google services without their grant. I think Google could bring you to justice for this use of their data.

# Case 4
In your development and testing of a medical device you collect a lot of sensitive medical data. Accidentally you find out that your colleague uses this data to train his AI-algorithm.

> What do you think? 

I guess you can't just take data out of a testing device for you own machine learning models. First you have to ask the producer of the medical devices if you could provide you with the data for this device. Further the patients which provide (probably without knowing) the data have to accept that their data is used for training an online machine learning model.
