## Innovation
**Is the gdpr a drawback for innovation?**
- Yes & No! Innovation is still possible but it requires more legal and technical attention!
- Chances for new privacy- and data protection-compliant technologies and services!
- SMEs (small and medium-sized companies) struggle with legal, organisational and technical demands. Big’s (FB, Google etc.) have an advantage.
- One of the winners are therefore cloud-services (i.e. AWS, Google, MS, IBM), because the can easier manage the systems than a small company!
